# yy-physics

A simple 2d physics engine to handle acceleration and velocity.

## NOTE
This is a work in progress, a simple 2d physics engine that meets the needs of my projects. I'll add functionality as needed, but I'm not looking to build out a full-featured physics engine as there are tons of them available.

## Features

Features ONLY include:

- acceleration and deceleration
- automatic turning to a specific angle
- automatic stopping

## Live Demo

## API
Coming soon...

## Installation

`npm i yy-physics`
